# loop killers
There are 100 men standing in a circle. One of them has a Beretta M9A3. This man shoots the man to his right, and hands over the pistol to the man to the right of the one who just died.

The third man shoots and kills the fourth. He hands over the pistol to the fifth man. This continues till there's only one left. Who is the last man standing?

# Note
I do not condone violence.
