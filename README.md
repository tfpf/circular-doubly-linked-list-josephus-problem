# Josephus Problem
There are 100 people standing in a circle. One of them has a Beretta M9A3. This
person shoots the one to their right, and hands over the pistol to the person
to the right of the one who just died.

The third person shoots the fourth and hands over the pistol to the fifth. This
continues till there's only one person left. Who will win this fiendish game?
Run

and then

# Note
I do not condone violence.
