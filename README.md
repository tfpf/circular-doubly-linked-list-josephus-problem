# Circular Doubly-Linked List
`CDLListNode.c` and `CDLList.c` provide an implementation of a circular
doubly-linked list of integers. These are used to solve a variant of the
Josephus problem.

# Josephus Problem
There are 100 people standing in a circle. One of them has a magic Beretta M9A3
with a bottomless magazine. This person shoots the one to their right, and
hands over the pistol to the person to the right of the one who just died.

The third person shoots the fourth and hands over the pistol to the fifth. This
continues till there's only one person left. Who will win this fiendish game?
Run
```
make
```
and then
```
./josephus 100
```
to find out.

# Note
I do not condone violence.
